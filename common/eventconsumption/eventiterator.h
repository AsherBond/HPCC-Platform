// An abstraction enabling an event pulling model. Consumers control the pace of event
// production by calling nextEvent() as needed.
//
// The interface is more simplistic than other iterators. A binary event file reader is considered
// to be a potential event source

// Implementation of IEventIterator that extracts event data from a property tree whose contents
// conform to this format (shown here as YAML):
//
// event:
// - type: <event name>
//   <event attribute name>: <value>
//
// In this format...
// - <event name> is any text label associated with an EventType enumerated value; and
// - <event attribute name> is any text label associated with an EventAttr enumerated value; and
// - `event` and `event/@type` are used in place of elements named for the event type because
//   IPropertyTree only preserves element order of elements with the same name; and
// - <value> is a text representation of the value to be assigned to the event attribute, where
//   the text must be directly convertible to the attribute's underlying data type. The only
//   exception is that a timestamp value may be a human readable date/time string instead of a
//   a number of nanoseconds.

# Overview

This folder has several examples using ESDL to create services, each in a subdirectory. Check the README.md file in each directory for example details and directions. Currently these examples are tailored for a bare-metal deployments, with container or cloud focused examples forthcoming. A brief description of each example is below:

| Example        | Description                                        |
-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| BasicRoxie     | A service running on Roxie customized with some simple ESDL Scripts. |
| CppPlugin      | A service running as a C++ plugin. |
| JavaPlugin     | A service running as a Java plugin. |
| Manifest       | A service running on Roxie customized with complex ESDL Scripts. The service configuration is built from a manifest file and separately maintained files in the EsdlScripts folder. This is to show how you can use configuration as code by managing complex service scripts in a code respository along with a manifest file to derive the final service configuration.|
| MySqlService   | A work in progress that will show how you can use a combination of ESDL Scripts and a backing MySql database to implment a service.

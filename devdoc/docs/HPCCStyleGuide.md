# HPCC Writing Style Guide

This section covers the best practice information for writing and
contributing to the HPCC Systems® Platform documentation.

## General

We strive to maintain a consistent voice. These guidelines can help your writing match that voice.

* **Use present tense, active voice**. Documentation should be you speaking directly to the reader. Simply tell them what to do.

    This example sentence:
    >The user selects the file menu.

    is passive voice. You wouldn’t say it that way in a conversation.

    You should use active voice wording, such as:
    >Select the file menu.

    Similarly, instructions like these are active voice:

    >Press the button.

     or

     >Submit the file.

    Documentation is you instructing the user. Just tell them what to do.

* **Be Brief and keep it simple.** Be efficient with your words. Keep sentences short and concise. Keep paragraphs short as well. Use just a few sentences per paragraph. Use simple words wherever possible and try to avoid lengthy explanations.

* **Consistency:** Be consistent. Use the same voice across all
    documents. Use the same term, use the same spelling, punctuation,
    etc. Follow the conventions in this guide.

* When writing formal documentation that is more than a new feature announcement, do not refer to a new feature, or coming features as such, this does not hold up well over time.

    Do not refer to how things were done in the past. For example, "in the past we had to do X-Y-Z steps and now we no longer have to. This ‘new feature’ can do it in one step, Z". This only adds potential confusion. Just instruct on exactly what needs to be done now, using words efficiently as possible, so for this example just say “perform
    step Z”

## Terms

There are many terms specific to HPCC Systems® and the HPCC Systems platform. Use the following style guide for word usage and capitalization guidelines to use when referring to system components or other HPCC-specific entities. Maintain consistent usage throughout all docs.

### HPCC Systems®

Officially and legally the organization's name is HPCC Systems® and it is a registered trademark.

You should always refer to the platform as the HPCC Systems® platform and the registration mark ® should appear in the first and most prominent mention of the name.

While it is acceptable to use the ® anywhere in a document, it is
required to be used in the first and most prominent mention so the average reader will be aware. Any usage after that first and most prominent is optional.

#### Products and Tools

* ARM

* Helm vs helm

    Helm is the name of the project, but the command line client is also named helm. By convention, when speaking of the project, Helm is capitalized. When speaking of the client, helm is in lowercase.

    For example:

    > Use the helm command line interface to install the Helm chart.

* Linux Bash vs bash

  In Linux Bash, "Bash" is capitalized to refer to the shell itself, while "bash" (lowercase) is used to refer to the command or script. Bash is the name of the shell, so it's capitalized like any proper noun, while the commands or scripts within the shell are lowercase. For example, you might say "I'm using the Bash shell," but you would execute a command like `bash myscript.sh`.

* macOS

* PowerShell

* SharePoint

#### Usage Instructions

* You **click** a link.

* You **select** a tab.

* You **press** a button.

* You **check** a (check)box.

### Word Choices

#### Write up vs Write-up

Hyphenated when used as a noun. No Hyphen when used as a verb phrase.

Examples:

* Did you read the write-up?

* Would you write up the steps to reproduce?

#### Assure vs ensure vs insure

To “assure” a person of something is to make him or her confident of it.

According to the Associated Press style, to “ensure” that something
happens is to make certain that it does, and to “insure” is to issue an
insurance policy.

Other authorities, however, consider “ensure” and “insure”
interchangeable. We prefer ensure when it is not talking about
insurance.
